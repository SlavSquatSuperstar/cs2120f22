Exists

Sets
- set comprehension (predicate)
- membership (predicate application)
- intersection
- union
- complement
- difference
- subset
  - equal (both subset)
- powerset (all subsets) (2^n)


Relations
- membership predicates (set of pairs)
- domain, domain of definition; co-domain, range
  - domain is 1st set
  - co-domain is 2nd set
  - domain of definition is domain with output in co-domain
  - range of definition is domain with input in domain
- single-valued (function)
- total (domain of definition is the domain)
- reflexive: relates all values in the domain to itself
- symmetric (both ways): if r a b, then r b a
- transitive (circular): whenever r a b, and r b c, then r a c (there can be no cases)
- equivalence: reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
- asymmetric
- anti-symmetric: if r a b and r b a, then a = b
- empty: doesn't relate anything to anything

Functions
- single-valued (not one to many): f(a) = x, f(a) = y -> x = y
- surjective (range is the codomain)
- injective (not many to one, invertible): f(a) = x, f(b) = x -> a = b
- bijective (one to one): both surjective and injective

Induction
1. Show it is good for 0
2. Show if it is good for n, it is good for n+1
