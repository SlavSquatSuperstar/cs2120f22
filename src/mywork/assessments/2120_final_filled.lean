Give a formal definition of the proposition
that for every natural number, n, there's a
natural number, m, that's one more than n.
Replace the _ placeholder with your answer.
We will call your proposition prop1.

Give a formal proof of this proposition. Include
a brief one line comment just before each line in 
your proof script explaining in English what it
does.

Write a brief English language proof of prop1.

Answer: Assume n is an arbitrary ‚Ñï, and show that
there is one larger number. The ‚Ñï n + 1,
satisfies this property.

We start by defining two "enumerated" data types, 
each with three values. We'll call them "lets" and
"nums," short for letters and numbers. The letters
are A, B, and C; and the numberrs are one, two, and
three.

| A
| B
| C

inductive nums : Type
| one
| two
| three

/- #A [5 points]

Define a function, l2n_ni (short for "letters to
numbers, not injective") using "by cases" syntax,
where l2n_ni is not injective. We don't care what
non-injective function you define, as long as it
is not injective. In a brief comment afterwards,
explain what makes it not injective.
-/

def l2n_ni : lets ‚Üí nums
| A := one
| B := one
| C := three

/-
Answer (what makes it non-injective?):
An injective function is not many-to-one, which means
if f(a) = f(b), then a = b. Since l2n_ni outputs one
for both A and B, and A ‚â† B, it is not injective.
-/


/- #B [5 points]

Define a function, l2n_s (short for "letters to
numbers, surjective") using "by cases" syntax,
where l2n_s is surjective. We don't care what
surjective function you define. 
-/

def l2n_s : lets ‚Üí nums
| A := one
| B := two
| C := three


/- #C [5 points] 

Write a brief English-language proof showing that
your function is surjective. You must cite what it
means to be surjective (be mathematically precise).
Hint: You'll have to assume you're given any letter
as input. What you do with that arbitrary value to
complete the proof is the question to answer. Once
you have that, the rest is pretty straightforward.

Answer: A surjective function is one whose output (range)
covers its entire co-domain. In this case, for any
arbritrary letter (A, B, or C), we can show that the
possible outputs are either equal to one, two, or three.
We can accomplish the above by just plugging all values of
"lets" into l2n_s and showing the range covers all the
enumerated values of "nums".

Write a formal definition of the predicate,
"is_even," taking a single natural number, n,
and reducing to the proposition that n mod 2
is 0. When you have it right, the first test
should pass, the second, fail, the third pass,
etc.

Define a function, prod_to: ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï, that,
when applied to a given n returns: 1 if n
is zero; and otherwise (if n = succ n' for 
some n') the product of n and prod_to n'. 
You likely have it right when the tests all
pass.

-- Answer: Natural numbers can be defined inductively,

/- #D [5 points]

This question tests your understanding of
the induction axiom for natural numbers.

You've learned that there are 2^n possible
"interpretations" of n propositional (i.e.,
Boolean) variables. Now *prove* that this 
is true. We'll help a bit. You fill in the
missing parts. 

1. The property, P, of n, we want to prove 
is that "the number of interpretations of 
a collection of n Boolean variables is 2^n." 

2. What we then want to prove is ‚àÄ n, P nn

3. What specific proposition do we want
to prove as the "base case" in a proof by
induction? Be mathematically precise.

Answer: Since the base case for ‚Ñï is 0, or nat.zero,
the base case of our proof is the number of
interpretations of 0 booleans is 2^0 = 1.

4. What specific proposition do we want to
prove as the "inductive case" in a proof by
induction? Be mathematically precise.

Answer: Since the inductive case for ‚Ñï is, n'+1,
or nat.succ, the inductive case of our proof is
the number of interpretations of n'+1 booleans
is 2^(n+1) = 2*2^n, or double the interpretations
for a collection of n booleans.

5. Which expression in your preceding answer
corresponds to the induction hypothesis?

Answer: The "n'+1" corresponds to the induction hypothesis,
wherein proofs are made using the proofs of previous values,
this eventually lead to the base value.

Prove the following formally, writing
a brief comment before each line of your
proof script describing the logical step
it implements. Then below the formal proof
give an English-language version of it.
If the second half of the proof uses the
same strategy as the first half, you can,
in English, say, "the rest of the proof
uses the same strategy," and be done.
-/

example : ‚àÄ (P Q : Prop), P ‚à® Q ‚Üî Q ‚à® P :=
begin
assume P Q : Prop, -- for-all intro, assume arbitrary P Q
split, -- iff intro, prove one-way implications
  -- forward
  assume p_or_q, -- arrow intro, assume the premise
  cases p_or_q with p q, -- use or elim (cases) to get P or Q
    -- use or intro to prove conclusion for both cases
    -- prove Q ‚à® P if P
    exact or.inr p,
    -- prove Q ‚à® P if Q
    exact or.inl q,

  -- reverse
  assume q_or_p, -- arrow intro, assume the premise
  cases q_or_p with q p, -- use or elim (cases) to get P or Q
    -- use or intro to prove conclusion for both cases
    -- prove P ‚à® Q if Q
    exact or.inr q,
    -- prove P ‚à® Q if P
    exact or.inl p,
end

/-
Proof:

1. To prove a bi-implication, it suffices to prove
both one-way implications are true.
2. For the forward implication (P ‚à® Q ‚Üí Q ‚à® P), we will
use arrow intro and assume the premise P ‚à® Q.
3. From or elim (cases), we can derive P is true or Q is true.
4. Looking at each case:
a) If P is true, we can use or intro right on P to prove Q ‚à® P.
b) If Q is true, we can use or intro left on Q to prove Q ‚à® P.
5. The rest of the proof, the reverse implication (Q ‚à® P ‚Üí P ‚à® Q),
uses the same strategy.

We define a new polymorphic data type, 
tree. A tree is either a "twig" that 
carries a value of some type Œ±; or a 
tree is a "root" that carries a value 
of type Œ± and two "children,"" each 
itself such a tree. The definition is
polymorphic in the sense that values
in the tree can be of any type, Œ±.

Define a tree, t, of natural numbers, with 0 
at the root and two sub-trees: the left is a 
twig with the value 1, and the right is a twig
with the value 2. Here's a diagram:

Define a function, tree_size, that takes any

simply prove that the twig has property P (i.e. P twig)
2. Inductive case: If the tree is a root (two children),
then prove that the root and both its subtrees have property P
(i.e. P root ‚àß P left ‚àß P right).
